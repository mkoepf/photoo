# Photoo - Product Vision

Photoo is a photo management application designed to help users organize their digital photographs from various sources (digital cameras, smartphonse, cloud services, e.g., Google Photos). 

In particular, the user should have a timeline view of their photos, and be able to easily search for photos based on metadata (e.g., date, location, people).

Photoo runs locally on the user's machine, and does not require an internet connection to function. It is designed to be fast and responsive, even with large photo libraries.

# MVP features

- import photos from local folders that have been synced from cloud services (e.g., Google Photos)
